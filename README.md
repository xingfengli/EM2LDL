# EM²LDL: A Multilingual Speech Corpus for Mixed Emotion Recognition through Label Distribution Learning

This study introduces EM²LDL, a novel multilingual speech corpus designed to advance mixed emotion recognition through label distribution learning. Addressing the limitations of predominantly monolingual and single-label emotion corpora that restrict linguistic diversity, are unable to model mixed emotions, and lack ecological validity, EM²LDL comprises expressive utterances in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, capturing the intra-utterance code-switching prevalent in multilingual regions like Hong Kong and Macao. The corpus integrates spontaneous emotional expressions from online platforms, annotated with fine-grained emotion distributions across 32 categories. Experimental baselines using self-supervised learning models demonstrate robust performance in speaker-independent gender-, age-, and personality-based evaluations, with HuBERT-large-EN achieving optimal results. By incorporating linguistic diversity and ecological validity, EM²LDL enables the exploration of complex emotional dynamics in multilingual settings. This work provides a versatile testbed for developing adaptive, empathetic systems for applications in affective computing, including mental health monitoring and cross-cultural communication.
